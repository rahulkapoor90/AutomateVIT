# AutomateVIT
Set of scripts i use to automate boring stuff at VIT University.

I use the following settings to "Start a program" in the task scheduler. I find it best to use the full path to the Python executable to be safe.

* Program/script: Full path to Python.exe, C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.2\python.exe

* Arguments: Name of script, script.py

* Start in: Location of script.py, something like C:\path\to\script

Also, if you pass in arguments to your script, include those with the arguments section, separated by spaces, script.py arg1 arg2 argn
